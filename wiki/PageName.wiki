#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Planned items =

== Data entry fields ==
* Average monthly electricity bill ($)
* Approx. square feet living area
* Zip code (+4?)

The above is used to compute a $/sq.ft value per entry.

== Google data store fields ==
*same as above + time stamp
*?zip code/boundary info

== User interactions ==
* Zoomable (default is at state-level)
* If user enters data once, remove the data entry pane
**Per session? Per data entry? Cookies?
* About page - 


== Potential visualizations ==
* Based on zoom level (default is at state-level zoom)
**Info for states
***+ Easy to add using google visualization API
**Info at zip code level
***-Hard to obtain zip code boundaries and computationally intensive
***+zoom level switch will make this a bit better
***+plot boundaries only for those which have data

* Histogram of $/sq.ft 
** Add a computed national average value (based on a nominal $/kWh) vertical line
** Overlay a nominal gaussian in light color?
** If user entered data is entered, show this on the histogram too

* Heat map at state level
** Heat map based on $/sq.ft
** Heat map based on number of participants
**# Look for visualization schemes to show both (one in color, other in size/?)
